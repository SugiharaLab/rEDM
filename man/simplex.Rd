\arguments{
\item{time_series}{either a vector to be used as the time series, or a 
data.frame or matrix with at least 2 columns (in which case the first 
column will be used as the time index, and the second column as the time 
series)}

\item{lib}{a 2-column matrix (or 2-element vector) where each row specifes 
the first and last *rows* of the time series to use for attractor 
reconstruction}

\item{pred}{(same format as lib), but specifying the sections of the time 
series to forecast.}

\item{norm_type}{the distance function to use. see 'Details'}

\item{P}{the exponent for the P norm}

\item{E}{the embedding dimensions to use for time delay embedding}

\item{tau}{the lag to use for time delay embedding}

\item{tp}{the prediction horizon (how far ahead to forecast)}

\item{num_neighbors}{the number of nearest neighbors to use (any of "e+1", 
"E+1", "e + 1", "E + 1" will peg this parameter to E+1 for each run, any
value < 1 will use all possible neighbors.)}

\item{stats_only}{specify whether to output just the forecast statistics or 
the raw predictions for each run}

\item{exclusion_radius}{excludes vectors from the search space of nearest 
neighbors if their *time index* is within exclusion_radius (NULL turns 
this option off)}

\item{epsilon}{excludes vectors from the search space of nearest neighbors 
if their *distance* is farther away than epsilon (NULL turns this option 
off)}

\item{silent}{prevents warning messages from being printed to the R console}

\item{theta}{the nonlinear tuning parameter (note that theta = 0 is 
equivalent to an autoregressive model of order E.)}

\item{save_smap_coefficients}{specifies whether to include the s_map 
coefficients with the output (and forces the full output as if stats_only 
were set to FALSE)}
}
\value{
For \code{simplex}, a data.frame with components for the parameters 
  and forecast statistics:
\tabular{ll}{
  E \tab embedding dimension\cr
  tau \tab time lag\cr
  tp \tab prediction horizon\cr
  nn \tab number of neighbors\cr
  num_pred \tab number of predictions\cr
  rho \tab correlation coefficient between observations and predictions\cr
  mae \tab mean absolute error\cr
  rmse \tab root mean square error\cr
  perc \tab percent correct sign\cr
  p_val \tab p-value that rho is significantly greater than 0 using Fisher's 
  z-transformation\cr
  const_rho \tab same as rho, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_mae \tab same as mae, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_rmse \tab same as rmse, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_perc \tab same as perc, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_p_val \tab same as p_val, but for the constant predictor
}
  If \code{stats_only == FALSE}, then additionally a list column:
\tabular{ll}{
  model_output \tab data.frame with columns for the time index, 
    observations, predictions, and estimated prediction variance\cr
}

For \code{s_map}, the same as for \code{simplex}, but with an 
  additional column for the value of theta. If 
  \code{save_smap_coefficients == TRUE}, then an additional list-column for 
  the S-map coefficients.
}
\description{
\code{simplex} uses time delay embedding on a single time 
  series to generate an attractor reconstruction, and then applies the 
  simplex projection algorithm to make forecasts.

\code{s_map} is similar to \code{simplex}, but uses the S-map 
  algorithm to make forecasts.
}
\details{
\code{simplex} is typically applied, and the embedding dimension 
varied, to find an optimal embedding dimension for the data. Thus, the 
default parameters are set so that passing a time series as the only 
argument will run over E = 1:10 (embedding dimension), using leave-one-out 
cross-validation over the whole time series, and returning just the forecast 
statistics.

\code{s_map} is typically applied, with fixed embedding dimension, and theta 
varied, to test for nonlinear dynamics in the data. Thus, the default 
parameters are set so that passing a time series as the only  argument will 
run over a default list of thetas (0, 0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 
0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8), using E = 1, 
leave-one-out cross-validation over the whole time series, and returning 
just the forecast statistics.

norm_type "L2 norm" (default) uses the typical Euclidean distance:
\deqn{distance(a,b) := \sqrt{\sum_i{(a_i - b_i)^2}}
}{distance(a, b) := \sqrt(\sum(a_i - b_i)^2)}
norm_type "L1 norm" uses the Manhattan distance:
\deqn{distance(a,b) := \sum_i{|a_i - b_i|}
}{distance(a, b) := \sum|a_i - b_i|}
norm type "P norm" uses the LP norm, generalizing the L1 and L2 norm to use 
  $P$ as the exponent:
\deqn{distance(a,b) := \sum_i{(a_i - b_i)^P}^{1/P}
}{distance(a, b) := (\sum(a_i - b_i)^P)^(1/P)}
}
