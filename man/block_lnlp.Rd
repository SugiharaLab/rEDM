\usage{
block_lnlp(block, lib = c(1, NROW(block)), pred = lib,
  norm_type = c("L2 norm", "L1 norm", "P norm"), P = 0.5,
  method = c("simplex", "s-map"), tp = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{block}{either a vector to be used as the time series, or a 
data.frame or matrix where each column is a time series}

\item{lib}{a 2-column matrix (or 2-element vector) where each row specifies 
the first and last *rows* of the time series to use for attractor 
reconstruction}

\item{pred}{(same format as lib), but specifying the sections of the time 
series to forecast.}

\item{norm_type}{the distance function to use. see 'Details'}

\item{P}{the exponent for the P norm}

\item{method}{the prediction method to use. see 'Details'}

\item{tp}{the prediction horizon (how far ahead to forecast)}

\item{num_neighbors}{the number of nearest neighbors to use. Note that the 
default value will change depending on the method selected. (any of "e+1", 
"E+1", "e + 1", "E + 1" will peg this parameter to E+1 for each run, any
value < 1 will use all possible neighbors.)}

\item{columns}{either a vector with the columns to use (indices or names), 
or a list of such columns}

\item{target_column}{the index (or name) of the column to forecast}

\item{stats_only}{specify whether to output just the forecast statistics or 
the raw predictions for each run}

\item{first_column_time}{indicates whether the first column of the given 
block is a time column (and therefore excluded when indexing)}

\item{exclusion_radius}{excludes vectors from the search space of nearest 
neighbors if their *time index* is within exclusion_radius (NULL turns 
this option off)}

\item{epsilon}{excludes vectors from the search space of nearest neighbors 
if their *distance* is farther away than epsilon (NULL turns this option 
off)}

\item{theta}{the nonlinear tuning parameter (theta is only relevant if 
method == "s-map")}

\item{silent}{prevents warning messages from being printed to the R console}

\item{save_smap_coefficients}{specifies whether to include the s_map 
coefficients with the output (and forces stats_only = FALSE, as well)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with components for the parameters and forecast 
  statistics:
\tabular{ll}{
  cols \tab embedding\cr
  tp \tab prediction horizon\cr
  nn \tab number of neighbors\cr
  num_pred \tab number of predictions\cr
  rho \tab correlation coefficient between observations and predictions\cr
  mae \tab mean absolute error\cr
  rmse \tab root mean square error\cr
  perc \tab percent correct sign\cr
  p_val \tab p-value that rho is significantly greater than 0 using Fisher's 
  z-transformation\cr
  const_rho \tab same as rho, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_mae \tab same as mae, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_rmse \tab same as rmse, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_perc \tab same as perc, but for the constant predictor\cr
  const_p_val \tab same as p_val, but for the constant predictor
}
If \code{stats_only == FALSE}, then additionally a list column:
\tabular{ll}{
  model_output \tab data.frame with columns for the time index, 
    observations, predictions, and estimated prediction variance\cr
}
If \code{save_smap_coefficients == TRUE} and "s-map" is the method, then 
  another list column:
\tabular{ll}{
  smap_coefficients \tab data.frame with columns for the coefficients of the 
  s-map\cr
}
}
\description{
\code{block_lnlp} uses multiple time series given as input to generate an 
  attractor reconstruction, and then applies the simplex projection or s-map 
  algorithm to make forecasts. This method generalizes the \code{simplex} 
  and \code{s-map} routines, and allows for "mixed" embeddings, where 
  multiple time series can be used as different dimensions of an attractor 
  reconstruction.
}
\details{
The default parameters are set so that passing a vector as the only argument
  will use that vector to predict itself one time step ahead. If a matrix or 
  data.frame is given as the only argument, the first column will be 
  predicted (one time step ahead), using the remaining columns as the 
  embedding. Rownames will be converted to numeric if possible to be used as 
  the time index, otherwise 1:NROW will be used instead. The default lib and 
  pred are for leave-one-out cross-validation over the whole time series, 
  and returning just the forecast statistics.

norm_type "L2 norm" (default) uses the typical Euclidean distance:
\deqn{distance(a,b) := \sqrt{\sum_i{(a_i - b_i)^2}}
}{distance(a, b) := \sqrt(\sum(a_i - b_i)^2)}
norm_type "L1 norm" uses the Manhattan distance:
\deqn{distance(a,b) := \sum_i{|a_i - b_i|}
}{distance(a, b) := \sum|a_i - b_i|}
norm type "P norm" uses the P norm, generalizing the L1 and L2 norm to use 
  $P$ as the exponent:
\deqn{distance(a,b) := \sum_i{(a_i - b_i)^P}^{1/P}
}{distance(a, b) := (\sum(a_i - b_i)^P)^(1/P)}

method "simplex" (default) uses the simplex projection forecasting algorithm

method "s-map" uses the s-map forecasting algorithm
