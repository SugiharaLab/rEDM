Description: An implementation of EDM algorithms based on research software developed for internal use at the Sugihara Lab (UCSD/SIO).  The package is implemented with 'Rcpp' wrappers around the 'cppEDM' library.  It implements the simplex projection method from Sugihara & May (1990) <doi:10.1038/344734a0>, the S-map algorithm from Sugihara (1994) <doi:10.1098/rsta.1994.0106>, convergent cross mapping described in Sugihara et al. (2012) <doi:10.1126/science.1227079>, and, multiview embedding described in Ye & Sugihara (2016) <doi:10.1126/science.aag0863>.
Note: Version 1.0 is a major rewrite of the 'rEDM' package as a wrapper for the 'cppEDM' library.  Function names and signatures have changed.  This allows a unified computation engine for EDM algorithms across C++, Python and R implementations.  The 'cppEDM' is written in a functional programming paradigm, facilitating clarity and ease of understanding to foster collaboration and extension.  The revised package provides improved alignment between observed and forecast data rows, and, strict exclusion of partial data vectors.  Gaussian process regression is not currently implemented.
