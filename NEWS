2020-05-05 version 1.3.7 <JosephPark@IEEE.org>

Version 1.3 is a major rewrite of the 'rEDM' package as a wrapper for the 'cppEDM' library.  This allows a unified computation engine for EDM algorithms across C++, Python and R implementations.  The revised package provides improved alignment between observed and forecast data rows, and, strict exclusion of partial data vectors.

To align with cppEDM and pyEDM, function names and signatures have changed. It is recommended to use the new function names: Simplex, SMap, CCM, Embed, Multiview, EmbedDimension, PredictInterval, PredictNonlinear, ComputeError. See https://sugiharalab.github.io/EDM_Documentation/ or the package documentation. 

A legacy function interface is provided to emulate function signatures of rEDM 0.7, but does not have complete coverage.  Implemented functions' include: simplex, s_map, block_lnlp, ccm, multiview, make_block, compute_stats and make_surrogate_data.  Functions ccm_means, tde_gp, block_gp and test_nonlinearity are deprecated.
